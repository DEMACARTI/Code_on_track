# Demo Seed Generation Plan

## 1. Vendors (6 Entities)
- **TechRail Solutions** (Reliability: 98%)
- **Global Track Systems** (Reliability: 92%)
- **Metro Build Corp** (Reliability: 88%)
- **RapidRail Parts** (Reliability: 95%)
- **SteelWorks Intl** (Reliability: 85%)
- **InfraCore Ltd** (Reliability: 99%)

## 2. Items (1500 Total)
- **Types**: ERC (60%), Sleeper (20%), Rail Pad (10%), Liner (10%)
- **Status Dist**:
  - `installed`: 60%
  - `manufactured`: 30%
  - `in_transit`: 5%
  - `failed`: 5%
- **Dates**: Distributed over last 60 days.

## 3. Lots & Health (125 Lots)
- **Aggregates**:
  - **CRITICAL**: 7 Lots (Mapped to Dashboard '7')
  - **HIGH**: 20 Lots
  - **MEDIUM**: ~98 Lots
- **Distribution Logic**:
  - Critical lots have > 5% failure rate in items.
  - High lots have 2-5% failure rate.
  - Medium lots have < 2% failure rate.
- **Mapping**: Each item assigned to a Lot No (e.g., `LOT-2023-001`).

## 4. Lot Quality (Samples)
- Random samples for each lot.
- Critical lots get poor dimension stats.
- Good lots get near-perfect stats.

## 5. Dashboard Consistency Enforcement
- **Constraint**: `count(distinct lot_no) WHERE risk_level='CRITICAL'` MUST be exactly 7.
- **Backend Fix Strategy**: Revert `analytics.py` to count only CRITICAL.
- **Frontend Strategy**: Keep `DashboardCriticalCount` component for added safety.

## 6. Notifications
- 10 sample notifications (Low/Medium/High severity).
- Recent timestamps.
