Weekly Defects Diagnosis
========================

1. Graph Source
---------------
- Frontend: `Dashboard.tsx` -> calls `/analytics/weekly_defects`.
- Backend: `analytics.py` -> `get_weekly_defects`.
- Logic: Queries `items` table for `status='failed'`.

2. Current State
----------------
- Items Table: 1250 items.
- Status Counts: 0 'failed'. (We have 'rejected', 'manufactured', 'installed' from reseed, but graph looks for 'failed').
- Data Recency: All items created Today.

3. Fix Plan
-----------
- Update 50 random items to `status='failed'`.
- Backdate their `created_at` timestamps to span the last 7 days.
- This will populate the graph buckets.

4. Artifacts
------------
- `artifacts/insert_weekly_defects.sql`: Generated SQL to perform updates.
