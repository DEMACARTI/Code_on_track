=== Frontend Lot Quality Analysis ===
Generated: 2025-12-12T10:08:00+05:30

== Component Location ==
File: frontend/src/pages/LotQuality.tsx

== API Route Called ==
api.get('/lot_quality/')
(Uses axios instance at frontend/src/api/axios.ts)

== Expected JSON Structure (LotQualityData interface) ==
{
  lot_no: string;
  component: string;        // MISMATCH: DB has "component_type"
  vendor_id: number;
  item_count: number;       // MISMATCH: DB has "total_items"
  failed: number;           // MISMATCH: DB has "failed_items"
  rate: number;             // MISMATCH: DB has "failure_rate"
  anomaly_score: number;    // OK
  reason: string;           // OK
  status: string;           // MISSING: DB doesn't have this
  last_inspected: string;   // MISMATCH: DB has "computed_at" or "last_updated"
}

== Error Handling ==
- Shows error message: "Error loading lot quality data" with AlertTriangle icon
- Error condition triggered when useQuery returns error state

== Field Mapping Issues ==
1. Frontend expects "component", DB has "component_type"
2. Frontend expects "item_count", DB has "total_items"
3. Frontend expects "failed", DB has "failed_items"
4. Frontend expects "rate", DB has "failure_rate"
5. Frontend expects "status" which doesn't exist in DB
6. Frontend expects "last_inspected", DB has "computed_at" or "last_updated"
