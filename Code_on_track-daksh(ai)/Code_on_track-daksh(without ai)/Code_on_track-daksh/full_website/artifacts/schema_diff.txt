Schema Diff Report
==================

Table: vendors
--------------
Missing Columns (Model vs DB):
- contact_info (JSON/JSONB): Present in Model, Missing in DB.
- metadata (JSON/JSONB): Present in Model (as metadata_), Missing in DB.

Table: lot_quality / lot_health
-------------------------------
- No SQLAlchemy ORM models found (using raw SQL in routers).
- Cannot verify schema against code.
- Assuming DB state is authoritative for now.

Recommendation:
- Apply migration to add missing `vendors` columns.
